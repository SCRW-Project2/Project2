       <h1>Recommended Project:</h1>
      <h2>Bamazon</h2>
      <br><br>
      <p>In this activity, you'll be creating an Amazon-like storefront with the MySQL skills you learned this week. The app will take in orders from customers and deplete stock from the store's inventory. As a bonus task, you can program your app to track product sales across your store's departments and then provide a summary of the highest-grossing departments in the store.
        <br><br>
      Make sure you save and require the MySQL and Inquirer npm packages in your homework files--your app will need them for data input and storage.</p>
      <br><br>
      
      <hr>
      <h2>Instructions</h2>
      <br><br>
      <p>### Challenge #1: Customer View (Minimum Requirement)</p>
<p>
1. Create a MySQL Database called `bamazon`.
</p><p>
2. Then create a Table inside of that database called `products`.
</p><p>
3. The products table should have each of the following columns:
</p><p>
   * item_id (unique id for each product)
<br>
   * product_name (Name of product)
<br>
   * department_name
<br>
   * price (cost to customer)
<br>
   * stock_quantity (how much of the product is available in stores)
</p><p>
4. Populate this database with around 10 different products. (i.e. Insert "mock" data rows into this database and table).
</p><p>
5. Then create a Node application called `bamazonCustomer.js`. Running this application will first display all of the items available for sale. Include the ids, names, and prices of products for sale.
</p><p>
6. The app should then prompt users with two messages.
</p><p>
   * The first should ask them the ID of the product they would like to buy.<br>
   * The second message should ask how many units of the product they would like to buy.
</p><p>
7. Once the customer has placed the order, your application should check if your store has enough of the product to meet the customer's request.
</p><p>
   * If not, the app should log a phrase like `Insufficient quantity!`, and then prevent the order from going through.
</p><p>
8. However, if your store _does_ have enough of the product, you should fulfill the customer's order.
</p><p>
   * This means updating the SQL database to reflect the remaining quantity.<br>
   * Once the update goes through, show the customer the total cost of their purchase.
</p><p>

</p><p>
* If this activity took you between 8-10 hours, then you've put enough time into this assignment. Feel free to stop here -- unless you want to take on the next challenge.
</p><p>

</p><p>
### Challenge #2: Manager View (Next Level)
</p><p>
* Create a new Node application called `bamazonManager.js`. Running this application will:
</p><p>
  * List a set of menu options:
</p><p>
    * View Products for Sale
    * View Low Inventory
    * Add to Inventory
    * Add New Product
</p><p>
  * If a manager selects `View Products for Sale`, the app should list every available item: the item IDs, names, prices, and quantities.
<br>
  * If a manager selects `View Low Inventory`, then it should list all items with an inventory count lower than five.
<br>
  * If a manager selects `Add to Inventory`, your app should display a prompt that will let the manager "add more" of any item currently in the store.
<br>
  * If a manager selects `Add New Product`, it should allow the manager to add a completely new product to the store.
</p><p>

<br>
* If you finished Challenge #2 and put in all the hours you were willing to spend on this activity, then rest easy! Otherwise continue to the next and final challenge.
<br>

</p><p>
### Challenge #3: Supervisor View (Final Level)
</p><p>
1. Create a new MySQL table called `departments`. Your table should include the following columns:
</p><p>
   * department_id
<br>
   * department_name
<br>
   * over_head_costs (A dummy number you set for each department)
</p><p>
2. Modify the products table so that there's a product_sales column and modify the `bamazonCustomer.js` app so that this value is updated with each individual products total revenue from each sale.
</p><p>
3. Modify your `bamazonCustomer.js` app so that when a customer purchases anything from the store, the price of the product multiplied by the quantity purchased is added to the product's product_sales column.
</p><p>
   * Make sure your app still updates the inventory listed in the `products` column.
</p><p>
4. Create another Node app called `bamazonSupervisor.js`. Running this application will list a set of menu options:
</p><p>
   * View Product Sales by Department
<br>
   * Create New Department
</p><p>
5. When a supervisor selects `View Product Sales by Department`, the app should display a summarized table in their terminal/bash window. Use the table below as a guide.
</p><p>
| department_id | department_name | over_head_costs | product_sales | total_profit |<br>
| ------------- | --------------- | --------------- | ------------- | ------------ |<br>
| 01            | Electronics     | 10000           | 20000         | 10000        |<br>
| 02            | Clothing        | 60000           | 100000        | 40000        |<br>
</p><p>
6. The `total_profit` column should be calculated on the fly using the difference between `over_head_costs` and `product_sales`. `total_profit` should not be stored in any database. You should use a custom alias.
</p><p>
7. If you can't get the table to display properly after a few hours, then feel free to go back and just add `total_profit` to the `departments` table.
</p><p>
   * Hint: You may need to look into aliases in MySQL.
<br>
   * Hint: You may need to look into GROUP BYs.
<br>
   * Hint: You may need to look into JOINS.
<br>
   * **HINT**: There may be an NPM package that can log the table to the console. What's is it? Good question :)
